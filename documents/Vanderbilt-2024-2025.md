high school graduation.

More information about other eligible (for financial aid purposes) non-citizens is available at
https://studentaid.gov/understandaid/eligibility/re quirements/non-us-citizens.

Nonresident - A person who is not a citizen or national of the United States and who is in this country on a student visa
or temporary basis and does not have the right to remain indefinitely. Do not include DACA, undocumented, or other
eligible noncitizens in this category.

* Service in the armed forces

* Foreign aid service of the federal government

* Official church missions

* No other adjustments to the initial cohort should be made.

For the cohort of all full-time bachelor’s (or equivalent) degree-seeking undergraduate students who entered your institution as
first-year students in Fall 2023 (or the preceding summer term), what percentage was enrolled at your institution as of the date
your institution calculates its official enrollment in Fall 2024.

Total students retained = students from the Fall 2023 cohort who are still enrolled as of Fall 2024 +
students from Fall 2023 cohort who completed their bachelor’s program as of Fall 2024

(Students from the Fall 2023 cohort still enrolled as of Fall 2024 + Students from Fall 2023 cohort who
completed their bachelor’s program as of Fall 2024)/(Adjusted Fall 2023 cohort) *100

Note: The number of first-time students seeking a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) who attain a
bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) by their second fall term is expected to be zero or very small. In
exceptional cases when a first-time student does satisfy all degree requirements including full credit
completion (e.g., typically 120 credit hours) and is awarded a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) by their
second fall term, they are to be considered “retained” for EF reporting purposes.

C1_—sC-FFirst-time, first-year students: Provide the number of degree-seeking, first-time, first-year students who applied,
were admitted, and enrolled (full- or part-time) in Fall 2024.

Include early decision, early action, and students who began studies during summer in this cohort.

Applicants should include only those students who fulfilled the requirements for consideration for
admission (i.e., who completed actionable applications) and who have been notified of one of the
following actions: admission, non-admission, placement on waiting list, or application withdrawn (by
applicant or institution).

Since the total may include students who did not provide gender data, the detail need not sum to the total.

If your institution collects and reports non-binary gender data, please use the "Another Gender" category.

Note that recent high school graduates and other students without prior postsecondary experience will still be

considered "first-time students" for fall enrollment reporting purposes even if they enrolled in the summer prior to
fall enrollment.

Provide numbers of students for each of the following categories as of the institution’s official fall reporting

date or as of October 15, 2024.

Common Data Set 2024-2025

### H1

### H. Financial Aid

Please refer to the following financial aid definitions when completina Section H.
Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.

Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid
applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized,
unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student
loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.

Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for
which the institution determines the recipient.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own
standards.

Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other
sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-
institutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).

Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other
sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify.

Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a
student must demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from
institutional, state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income)
awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When
reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need-
based aid.

Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:

1. Non-need institutional grants 6. Non-need outside grants
2. Non-need tuition waivers 7. Non-need student loans
3. Non-need athletic awards 8. Non-need parent loans
4. Non-need federal grants 9. Non-need work

5. Non-need state grants

Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student
need not demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Private student loans: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or private lender
used to pay for up to the annual cost of education, less any financial aid received.

External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that
students bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to
receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.

Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your
institution in financial aid awards.

Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates

Enter total dollar amounts awarded to enrolled full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking undergraduates
(using the same cohort reported in CDS Question B1, “total degree-seeking” undergraduates) in the
following categories.

* If the data being reported are final figures for the 2023-2024 academic year (see the next item below),
use the 2023-2024 academic year’s CDS Question B1 cohort.

* Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid).

« Aid that is non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported in the need-based aid
column.

* Fora suggested order of precedence in assigning categories of aid to cover need, see the entry for “non-

need-based scholarship or grant aid” on the last page of the definitions section.

1-3. Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class
sections offered in the Fall 2024 term.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number,
meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or
discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-
seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes
and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings.
Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor
sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once
and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation,
and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the
lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which
degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual
instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class
subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class
sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2024. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at
another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+” column in the class
section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections table.

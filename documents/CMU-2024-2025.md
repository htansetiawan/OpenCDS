its annual Faculty Compensation Survey (the part-time definitions are not used by AAUP). Instructional Faculty is de-
fined as those members of the instructional-research staff whose major regular assignment is instruction, including
those with released time for research. Use the directions below to determine inclusions and exclusions:

B. Administrative officers with titles such as dean of students, librarian, coach, and | Exclude __| Include if they teach
the like, even though they may devote part of their time to classroom instruc- one or more non-

Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, or Hispanic.

I. INSTRUCTIONAL FACULTY AND CLASS SIZE (continued)

13. Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class sec-
tions offered in the Fall 2024 term.

Class Sections
A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number, meeting at a stated time
or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion section. Undergradu-
ate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled
for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or
thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative pro-
grams, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in on-on-one classes. Each class
section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections
A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as a laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections
that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Under-
graduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students en-
rolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research,
music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be dupli-

cated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and
class subsections offered in Fall 2024. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in 40 sep-
arate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+” column in the class section column and 40 times un-

der the “20-20” column of the class subsections table.

#### J. DISCIPLINARY AREAS OF DEGREES CONFERRED

Degrees conferred between July 1, 2023 and June 30, 2024

For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor’s

degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a dou-

ble major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution’s IPEDS Completions by using the

sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st majors and the

Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using 1st majors only.

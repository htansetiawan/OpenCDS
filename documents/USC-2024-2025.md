« Include international students only in the category "Nonresidents."
* Complete the “Total Undergraduates” column only if you cannot provide data for the first two columns.
« Report as your institution reports to IPEDS: persons who are Hispanic should be reported only on the

Hispanic line, not under any race, and persons who are non-Hispanic multi-racial should be reported only
under "Two or more races."

« New guidance from IPEDS for reporting aggregate data:
Racial/ethnic designations are requested only for United States citizens, residents, and other eligible non-citizens.
Eligible non-citizens include all students who completed high school or a GED equivalency within the United States

(including DACA and undocumented students) and who were not on an F-1 non-immigrant student visa at the time of
high school graduation.

More information about other eligible (for financial aid purposes) non-citizens is available at

Common Data Set 2024-2025

Report for the cohort of all full-time, first-time bachelor’s (or equivalent) degree-seeking undergraduate students who entered in Fall 2023 (or tt
summer term).

* The initial cohort may be adjusted for students who departed for the following reasons:
* Death

* Permanent Disability

* Service in the armed forces

* Foreign aid service of the federal government

* Official church missions

* No other adjustments to the initial cohort should be made.

B22 For the cohort of all full-time bachelor’s (or equivalent) degree-seeking undergraduate students who entered your
institution as first-year students in Fall 2023 (or the preceding summer term), what percentage was enrolled at your
institution as of the date your institution calculates its official enrollment in Fall 2024.

Total students retained = students from the Fall 2023 cohort who are still enrolled as of Fall 2024 +
students from Fall 2023 cohort who completed their bachelor’s program as of Fall 2024

(Students from the Fall 2023 cohort still enrolled as of Fall 2024 + Students from Fall 2023 cohort
who completed their bachelor’s program as of Fall 2024)/(Adjusted Fall 2023 cohort) *100

Note: The number of first-time students seeking a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) who attain a
bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) by their second fall term is expected to be zero or very small. In
exceptional cases when a first-time student does satisfy all degree requirements including full
credit completion (e.g., typically 120 credit hours) and is awarded a bachelor’s degree (or

equivalent) by their second fall term, they are to be considered “retained” for EF reporting
purposes.

Common Data Set 2024-2025

### H1

### H. Financial Aid

Please refer to the following financial aid definitions when completing Section H.
Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.

Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid
applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized,
unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student
loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.

Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for
which the institution determines the recipient.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's
own standards.

Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other
sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-
institutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).

Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other
sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify.

Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a
student must demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from
institutional, state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income)
awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When
reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need-
based aid.

Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:

1. Non-need institutional grants 6. Non-need outside grants
2. Non-need tuition waivers 7. Non-need student loans
3. Non-need athletic awards 8. Non-need parent loans
4. Non-need federal grants 9. Non-need work

5. Non-need state grants

Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a
student need not demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Private student loans: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or private lender
used to pay for up to the annual cost of education, less any financial aid received.

External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that
students bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process
paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount

Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your
institution in financial aid awards.

Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates

Enter total dollar amounts awarded to enrolled full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking

undergraduates (using the same cohort reported in CDS Question B1, “total degree-seeking”

undergraduates) in the following categories.

* — If the data being reported are final figures for the 2023-2024 academic year (see the next item below),
use the 2023-2024 academic year's CDS Question B1 cohort.

* Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid).

« Aid that is non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported in the need-based aid
column.

* Fora suggested order of precedence in assigning categories of aid to cover need, see the entry for

“non-need-based scholarship or grant aid” on the last page of the definitions section.

and 2,414 |faculty).

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and
class sections offered in the Fall 2024 term.

I-3. Undergraduate Class Size

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and
number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a
laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at
least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes
and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction,
or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign
language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section
should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory,
recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet
separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any
subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above,
exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music
instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be
duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class
sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2024. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who
met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+” column in
the class section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections table.

J. Disciplinary areas of DEGREES CONFERRED

Degrees conferred between July 1, 2023 and June 30, 2024

For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor’s degrees awarded. To
determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice).
Calculate the percentage from your institution’s IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the
numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can
compute the percentages using 1st majors only.

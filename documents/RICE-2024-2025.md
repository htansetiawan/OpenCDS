### B. Enrollment And Persistence

B2_ Enrollment by Racial/Ethnic Category.
Provide numbers of undergraduate students for each of the following categories as of the institution’s official fall reporting
date or as of October 15, 2024.
* — Include international students only in the category "Nonresidents."
* Complete the “Total Undergraduates” column only if you cannot provide data for the first two columns.
« Report as your institution reports to IPEDS: persons who are Hispanic should be reported only on the

Hispanic line, not under any race, and persons who are non-Hispanic multi-racial should be reported only
under "Two or more races."

« New guidance from IPEDS for reporting aggregate data:

Racial/ethnic designations are requested only for United States citizens, residents, and other eligible non-citizens.
Eligible non-citizens include all students who completed high school or a GED equivalency within the United States
(including DACA and undocumented students) and who were not on an F-1 non-immigrant student visa at the time of
high school graduation.

More information about other eligible (for financial aid purposes) non-citizens is available at
https://studentaid.gov/understandaid/eligibility/requirements/non-us-citizens.

Nonresident - A person who is not a citizen or national of the United States and who is in this country on a student visa
or temporary basis and does not have the right to remain indefinitely. Do not include DACA, undocumented, or other
eligible noncitizens in this category.

NOTE - Nonresidents are to be reported separately, in the boxes provided, rather than included in any of the seven
racial/ethnic categories or in race/ethnicity unknown.

Dual Enrollment: If your institution enrolls high school students in college courses for credit either within a dual enrollment
program or outside of a dual enrollment program, you may report the unduplicated count as part of the non-degree-seeking
students included in the “Total Undergraduates (both degree & non-degree-seeking)” section.

B4-B21: Graduation Rates

The items in this section correspond to data elements collected by the IPEDS Web-based Data Collection System’s
Graduation Rate Survey (GRS).

* For complete instructions and definitions of data elements, see the IPEDS GRS Forms and Instructions
for the 2024-2025 Survey. https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data/survey-components/9/graduation-rates

In the following section for bachelor’s or equivalent programs, please disaggregate the Fall 2017 and Fall 2018
#### cohorts (formerly CDS B4-B11) into four groups:

* Students who received a Federal Pell Grant*

* Recipients of a subsidized Stafford Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant

* Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a subsidized Stafford Loan

* Total (all students, regardless of Pell Grant or subsidized loan status)

*Students who received both a Federal Pell Grant and a subsidized Stafford Loan should be reported in the "Recipients of a
Federal Pell Grant" column.

For each graduation rate grid below, the numbers in the first three columns for Questions A-G should sum to the cohort total
in the fourth column (formerly CDS B4-B11).

For Bachelor’s or Equivalent Programs

Please provide data for the Fall 2018 cohort if available. If Fall 2018 cohort data are not available, provide data for the Fall
2017 cohort.

### H. Financial Aid

Please refer to the following financial aid definitions when completing Section H.
Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.

Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid applications/forms, such as the
### Fafsa.

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized, unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding
parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the
student and should be included.

Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which the institution determines the
recipient.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own standards.

Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must
have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-institutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).

Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must
have financial need to qualify.

Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must demonstrate financial
need to qualify.

Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional, state, federal, or other
sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any
other non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as
need-based aid.

Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:

1. Non-need institutional grants 6. Non-need outside grants
2. Non-need tuition waivers 7. Non-need student loans
3. Non-need athletic awards 8. Non-need parent loans
4. Non-need federal grants 9. Non-need work

5. Non-need state grants

Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student need not demonstrate financial
need to qualify.

Private student loans: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or private lender used to pay for up to the annual
cost of education, less any financial aid received.

External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that students bring with them (e.g.,
Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the
recipient or the dollar amount awarded.

Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your institution in financial aid awards.

Do NOT include any aid related to the CARES Act or unique to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates

H1 Enter total dollar amounts awarded to enrolled full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking undergraduates (using the same cohort
reported in CDS Question B1, “total degree-seeking” undergraduates) in the following categories.

« — If the data being reported are final figures for the 2023-2024 academic year (see the next item below),
use the 2023-2024 academic year's CDS Question B1 cohort.
* — Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid).

¢ Aid that is non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported in the need-based aid
column.

#### I. INSTRUCTIONAL FACULTY AND CLASS SIZE

1-3. Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and
class sections offered in the Fall 2024 term.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and
number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a
laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least
one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and
noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-
to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign
language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section
should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory,
recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet
separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any
subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above,
exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music
instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be
duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class
sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2024. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met
at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+” column in the
class section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections table.

#### J. DISCIPLINARY AREAS OF DEGREES CONFERRED

J1 Degrees conferred between July 1, 2023 and June 30, 2024
For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor’s
degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double
major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution’s IPEDS Completions by using the sum of
1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total
by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using 1st majors only.

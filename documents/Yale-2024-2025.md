The items in this section correspond to data elements collected by the IPEDS Web-based Data Collection System’s

Graduation Rate Survey (GRS).

V For complete instructions and definitions of data elements, see the IPEDS GRS Forms and Instructions for the 2024 -
2025 Survey. https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data/survey-components/9/graduation-rates

In the following section for bachelor’s or equivalent programs, please disaggregate the Fall 2017 and Fall 2018

#### cohorts (formerly CDS B4-B11) into four groups:

° Students who received a Federal Pell Grant*

° Recipients of a subsidized Stafford Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant

° Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a subsidized Stafford Loan
° Total (all students, regardless of Pell Grant or subsidized loan status)

* Students who received both a Federal Pell Grant and a subsidized Stafford Loan should be reported in the

“Recipients of a Federal Pell Grant” column.

For each graduation rate grid below, the numbers in the first three columns for Questions A-G should sum to the cohort total

in the fourth column (formerly CDS B4-B11).

For Bachelor’s or Equivalent Programs

Please provide data for the Fall 2018 cohort if available. If Fal1 2018 cohort data are not available, provide data for

V The initial cohort may be adjusted for students who departed for the following reasons:

. Death

. Permanent Disability

. Service in the armed forces

. Foreign aid service of the federal government

. Official church missions

. No other adjustments to the initial cohort should be made.

For the cohort of all full-time bachelor’s (or equivalent) degree-seeking undergraduate students who entered your
institution as first-year students in Fall 2023 (or the preceding summer term), what percentage was enrolled at
your institution as of the date your institution calculates its official enrollment in Fall 2024

Total students retained = students from the Fall 2023 cohort who are still enrolled as of Fall 2024 + students
from Fall 2023 cohort who completed their bachelor’s program as of Fall 2024

(Students from the Fall 2023 cohort still enrolled as of Fall 2024 + Students from Fall 2023 cohort who
completed their bachelor’s program as of Fall 2024)/(Adjusted Fall 2023 cohort) * 100

Note: The number of first-time students seeking a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) who attain a bachelor’s degree (or
equivalent) by their second fall term is expected to be zero or very small. In exceptional cases when a first-time
student does satisfy all degree requirements including full credit completion (e.g., typically 120 credit hours) and is
awarded a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) by their second fall term, they are to be considered “retained” for EF
reporting purposes.

C1-C2: Applications

Cl. First-time, first-year students: Provide the number of degree-seeking, first-time, first-year students who applied, were
admitted, and enrolled (full- or part-time) in Fall 2024.

V Include early decision, early action, and students who began studies during summer in this cohort.

Y Applicants should include only those students who fulfilled the requirements for consideration for admission (i.e., who
completed actionable applications) and who have been notified of one of the following actions: admission, non-admission,
placement on waiting list, or application withdrawn (by applicant or institution).

Y Admitted applicants should include wait-listed students who were subsequently offered admission.

VY Since the total may include students who did not provide gender data, the detail need not sum to the total.

V If your institution collects and reports non-binary gender data, please use the “Another Gender” category.

Y Note that recent high school graduates and other students without prior postsecondary experience will still be considered
“first-time students” for fall enrollment reporting purposes even if they enrolled in the summer prior to fall enrollment.

### H. Financial Aid

Please refer to the following financial aid definitions when completing Section H.
Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.

Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid applications/forms,
such as the FAFSA.

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized, unsubsidized,
private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student loans co-signed by a parent are
assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.

Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which the
institution determines the recipient.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution’s own standards.

Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a
student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-institutional student aid (grants, jobs,
and loans).

Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a
student must have financial need to qualify.

Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must
demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional, state,
federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of
academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid
that is used to meet need should be counted as need-based aid.

Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:
1. Non-need institutional grants
2. Non-need tuition waivers
3. Non-need athletic awards
4. Non-need federal grants
5. Non-need state grants

6. Non-need outside grants

7. Non-need student loans

8. Non-need parent loans
9. Non-need work

Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student need not
demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Private student loans: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or private lender used to pay for up
to the annual cost of education, less any financial aid received.

External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that students bring with
them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no
role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.

Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your institution in
financial aid awards.

DO NOT INCLUDE ANY AID RELATED TO THE CARES ACT OR UNIQUE THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates

H1. Enter total dollar amounts awarded to enrolled full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking undergraduates (using
the same cohort reported in CDS Question B1, “total degree-seeking” undergraduates) in the following categories.

V If the data being reported are final figures for the 2023-2024 academic year (see the next item below), use the 2023 -
2024 academic year’s CDS Question B1 cohort.

V Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid).
V Aid that is non-need-based but that was used to meet need should [be reported in the need-based aid column].

V For a suggested order of precedence in assigning categories of aid to cover need, see the entry for “non-need-based
scholarship or grant aid” on the last page of the definitions section.

Y¥ Do NOT include any aid related to the CARES Act or unique to the COVID-19 pandemic.

enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or
thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs,
internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section
should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion
subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course.
Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students
enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research,
music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated
because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class
subsections offered in Fall 2024. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in 40 separate labs
with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+” column in the class section column and 40 times under the “20-29”
column of the class subsections table.

J. Disciplinary areas of DEGREES CONFERRED
Degrees conferred between July 1, 2023 and June 30, 2024

For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor’s degrees
awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be
represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution’s IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1 and 2"4
majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by Ist Majors and the Grand Total by 2"! major as
the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using 1 majors only.

Financial Aid Definitions

External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that students bring with
them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no
role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.

Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid applications/forms,
such as the FAFSA.

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized, unsubsidized,
private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student loans co-signed by a parent are
assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.

Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which the
institution determines the recipient.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution’s own standards.

Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a
student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-institutional student aid (grants, jobs,
and loans).

Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a
student must have financial need to qualify.

Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must
demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional, state,
federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of
academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid
that is used to meet need should be counted as need-based aid.
Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:

1. Non-need institutional grants

2. Non-need tuition waivers

3. Non-need athletic awards

4. Non-need federal grants

5. Non-need state grants

6. Non-need outside grants

7. Non-need student loans

8. Non-need parent loans

9. Non-need work

Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student need not
demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your institution in
financial aid awards.

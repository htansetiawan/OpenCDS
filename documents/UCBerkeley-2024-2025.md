* Include international students only in the category "Nonresidents."

* Complete the “Total Undergraduates” column only if you cannot provide data for the first two
columns.

¢ Report as your institution reports to IPEDS: persons who are Hispanic should be reported only on the
Hispanic line, not under any race, and persons who are non-Hispanic multi-racial should be reported only
under "Two or more races."

« New guidance from IPEDS for reporting aggregate data: "Racial/ethnic designations are requested only for
United States citizens, residents, and other eligible non-citizens.

Eligible non-citizens include all students who completed high school or a GED equivalency within the United
States (including DACA and undocumented students) and who were not on an F-1 non-immigrant student
visa at the time of high school graduation.

More information about other eligible (for financial aid purposes) non-citizens is available at https:
//studentaid.gov/understandaid/eligibility/requirements/non-us-citizens.

Nonresident — A person who is not a citizen or national of the United States and who is in this country on a
student visa or temporary basis and does not have the right to remain indefinitely. Do not include DACA,
undocumented, or other eligible noncitizens in this category.

NOTE- Nonresidents are to be reported separately, in the boxes provided, rather than included in any of the
seven racial/ethnic categories or in race/ethnicity unknown.

Dual Enrollment: If your institution enrolls high school students in college courses for credit either within a
dual enrollment program or outside of a dual enrollment program, you may report the unduplicated count as
part of the non-degree-seeking students included in the "Total Undergraduates (both degree & non-degree-
seeking)" section.

Total 5,893

Six-year graduation rate for 2017 cohort (G divided _ Total

by C)

Recipients of a Federal Pell Grant 88.4%
Recipients of a Subsidized Stafford Loan who did not receive 90.8%
Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a 94.3%
Total 92.9%

For the cohort of all full-time bachelor’s (or equivalent)

degree-seeking undergraduate students who entered your

institution as first-year students in Fall 2023 (or the preceding

summer term), what percentage was enrolled at your

institution as of the date your institution calculates its official

enrollment in Fall 2024. 96.80%

Total students retained = students from the Fall 2023 cohort who are still enrolled as of Fall
2024 + students from Fall 2023 cohort who completed their bachelor’s program as of Fall
2024

(Students from the Fall 2023 cohort still enrolled as of Fall 2024 + Students from Fall 2023
cohort who completed their bachelor’s program as of Fall 2024)/(Adjusted Fall 2023 cohort)
*100

Note: The number of first-time students seeking a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) who
attain a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) by their second fall term is expected to be zero or
very small. In exceptional cases when a first-time student does satisfy all degree
requirements including full credit completion (e.g., typically 120 credit hours) and is

institution as first-year students in Fall 2023 (or the preceding
summer term), what percentage was enrolled at your

Note: The number of first-time students seeking a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) who
attain a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) by their second fall term is expected to be zero or
very small. In exceptional cases when a first-time student does satisfy all degree
requirements including full credit completion (e.g., typically 120 credit hours) and is
awarded a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) by their second fall term, they are to be
considered “retained” for EF reporting purposes. |  |

First-time, first-year students: Provide the number of degree-seeking, first-time, first-year students who applied, were admitted,
and enrolled (full- or part-time) in Fall 2024.

¢ Include early decision, early action, and students who began studies during summer in this cohort.

¢ Applicants should include only those students who fulfilled the requirements for consideration for admission (i.e., who
completed actionable applications) and who have been notified of one of the following actions: admission, non-admission,
placement on waiting list, or application withdrawn (by applicant or institution).

¢ Since the total may include students who did not provide gender data, the detail need not sum to the total.

¢ If your institution collects and reports non-binary gender data, please use the “Another Gender” category.

¢ Note that recent high school graduates and other students without prior postsecondary experience will still be considered
“first-time students” for fall enrollment reporting purposes even if they enrolled in the summer prior to fall enrollment.

* Provide numbers of students for each of the following categories as of the institution's official fall reporting date or as of
October 15, 2024

| C1-C2: Applications
First-time, first-year students: Provide the number of degree-seeking, first-time, first-year students who applied, were admitted,
and enrolled (full- or part-time) in Fall 2024.
• Include early decision, early action, and students who began studies during summer in this cohort.
• Applicants should include only those students who fulfilled the requirements for consideration for admission (i.e., who
completed actionable applications) and who have been notified of one of the following actions: admission, non-admission,
placement on waiting list, or application withdrawn (by applicant or institution).
• Since the total may include students who did not provide gender data, the detail need not sum to the total.
• If your institution collects and reports non-binary gender data, please use the “Another Gender” category.
• Note that recent high school graduates and other students without prior postsecondary experience will still be considered
“first-time students” for fall enrollment reporting purposes even if they enrolled in the summer prior to fall enrollment.
• Provide numbers of students for each of the following categories as of the institution's official fall reporting date or as of
October 15, 2024 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |  |

UC Berkeley is test-free, which means we will not use
SAT/ACT test scores in any part of our application
process.

Berkeley has always used, and will continue to use,
holistic review, which means there is no one sole factor
on the application that will determine a student’s
admission status. SAT/ACT test scores were not the only
academic indicators available on the application to
assess students. Other academic indicators will
continue to be assessed in the review process, including
grades, the rigor of a student's courses, other non-
required tests (SAT subject test, AP tests, IB test, etc.),
and a student’s individual academic context.

While SAT/ACT scores will not be used in the admissions
process, any scores submitted to Berkeley will be used

due to differences by academic program, student academic background, or if for placement or subject credit purposes should the
other examinations may be considered in lieu of the SAT and ACT): student be admitted to Berkeley.

If necessary, use this space to clarify your test policies (e.g., if tests are
recommended for some students, or if tests are not required of some students

Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class sections offered in the
term.
* Do not count undergraduate or graduate teaching assistants as faculty.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number, meeting at a stated time
a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are def
sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and non
classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students
independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-
Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsection
supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are
any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes
individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should
only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class subsec

| In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class sections offered in the
term.
• Do not count undergraduate or graduate teaching assistants as faculty.
Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number, meeting at a stated time
a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are def
sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and non
classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students
independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on
Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.
Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsection
supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are
any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes
individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should
only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.
Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class subsec
in Fall 2024. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be c
in the “100+” column in the class section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections table.

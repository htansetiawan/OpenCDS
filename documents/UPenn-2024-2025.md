Provide 2025-26 academic year costs of attendance for the following categories that are applicable to your institution.

Check here if your institution's 2025-26 academic year costs of attendance are not available at this time and provide an approximate date (i.e., month/day) when

your institution's final 2025-26 academic year costs of attendance will be available:

### Final

Undergraduate full-time tuition, required fees, room and board List the typical tuition, required fees, and room and board for a full-time

undergraduate student for the FULL 2025-26 academic year
(30 semester or 45 quarter hours for institutions that derive annual tuition by multiplying credit hour cost by number of credits). A full academic year refers to

the period of time generally extending from September to June; usually equated to two semesters, two trimesters, three quarters, or the period covered by a
four-one-four plan. Room and board is defined as double occupancy and |9 meals per week or the maximum meal plan. Required fees include only charges that
all full-time students must pay that are not included in tuition (e.g., registration, health, or activity fees.) Do not include optional fees (e.g., parking, laboratory

use).

### H. Financial Aid

Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates

Enter total dollar amounts awarded to enrolled full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking undergraduates (using the same cohort reported in CDS Question Bl,

“total degree-seeking” undergraduates) in the following categories.

(Note: If the data being reported are final figures for the 2023-24 academic year (see the next item below), use the 2023-24 academic year's CDS Question Bl
cohort.)

Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid). Aid that is non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be

reported in the need-based aid column. (For a suggested order of precedence in assigning categories of aid to cover need, see the entry for “non-
need-based scholarship or grant aid” on the last page of the definitions section.)

#### I. INSTRUCTIONAL FACULTY AND CLASS SIZE

Il Please report the number of instructional faculty members in each category for Fall 2024. Include faculty who are on your institution’s payroll on the

census date your institution uses for IPEDS/AAUP.

The following definition of full-time instructional faculty is used by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) in its annual Faculty Compensation Survey

(the part time definitions are not used by AAUP). Instructional Faculty is defined as those members of the instructional-research staff whose major regular assignment is

instruction, including those with released time for research. Use the chart below to determine inclusions and exclusions:

Full-time Part-time
Include only if
; ; . . a ; ; . ; they teach one

(e) faculty on sabbatical or leave with pay Include Exclude
(f) faculty on leave without pay Exclude Exclude
(g) replacement faculty for faculty on sabbatical leave or leave with pay Exclude Include

Full-time instructional faculty: faculty employed on a full-time basis for instruction (including those with released time for research)

Part-time instructional faculty: Adjuncts and other instructors being paid solely for part-time classroom instruction. Also includes full-time faculty teaching less than two

semesters, three quarters, two trimesters, or two four-month sessions. Employees who are not considered full-time instructional faculty but who teach one or more non-

clinical credit courses may be counted as part-time faculty.

Minority faculty: includes faculty who designate themselves as Black, non-Hispanic; American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, or Hispanic.

Doctorate: includes such degrees as Doctor of Philosophy, Doctor of Education, Doctor of Juridical Science, and Doctor of Public Health in any field such as arts, sciences, education,

engineering, business, and public administration. Also includes terminal degrees formerly designated as “first professional,” including dentistry (DDS or DMD), medicine (MD), optometry
(OD), osteopathic medicine (DO), pharmacy (DPharm or BPharm), podiatric medicine (DPM), veterinary medicine (DVM), chiropractic (DC or DCM), or law (JD).

Terminal degree: the highest degree in a field: example, M. Arch (architecture) and MFA (master of fine arts).

Report the Fall 2024 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus |/3 part time) to full-time equivalent instructional faculty (full time plus 1/3 part time).

In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty and students in stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry, social work,

business, or public health in which faculty teach virtually only graduate-level students. Do not count undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.

and 1,323 ] faculty).

13 Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class sections offered in the Fall 2024 term.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar
setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking
undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music
instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all

students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and
are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking
undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-

to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2024.)

For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+” column in the class

section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections table.

### J. Degrees Conferred

Jl Degrees conferred between July |, 2023 and June 30, 2024

For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor’s degrees awarded. To determine the
percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your
institution’s IPEDS Completions by using the sum of Ist and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by Ist

Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using Ist majors only.

Common Data Set Definitions

All definitions related to the financial aid section appear at the end of the Definitions document.

Financial Aid Definitions

Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.

External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that students bring with them
(e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no role in

determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.

Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid applications/forms, such as
the FAFSA.

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized, unsubsidized, private, etc.;
excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the

responsibility of the student and should be included.

Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which the institution

determines the recipient.
Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own standards.
Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a

student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and noninstitutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).

Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a
student must have financial need to qualify.

Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must demonstrate
financial need to qualify.

Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional, state, federal, or
other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement,

merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When reporting questions HI and H2, non-need-based aid that is used to meet need

should be counted as need-based aid.
Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:
Non-need institutional grants
Non-need tuition waivers

Non-need athletic awards

Non-need federal grants

Non-need state grants

Non-need outside grants

Non-need student loans

Non-need parent loans

Non-need work

Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student need not demonstrate

financial need to qualify.

Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your institution in financial aid

awards.

Common Data Set 2024-2025

B2_ Enrollment by Racial/Ethnic Category
Provide numbers of undergraduate students for each of the following categories as of the institution’s official fall reporting date or as of
October 15, 2024.
* Include international students only in the category "International."

* Report as your institution reports to IPEDS: persons who are Hispanic should be reported only on the Hispanic line, not under any race, and
persons who are non-Hispanic multi-racial should be reported only under "Two or more races."

* New guidance from IPEDS for reporting aggregate data:

Racial/ethnic designations are requested only for United States citizens, residents, and other eligible non-citizens. Eligible non-citizens
include all students who completed high school or a GED equivalency within the United States (including DACA and undocumented
students) and who were not on an F-1 non-immigrant student visa at the time of high school graduation.

More information about other eligible (for financial aid purposes) non-citizens is available at
https://studentaid.gov/understandaid/eligibility/requirements/non-us-citizens.

International (Nonresident):A person who is not a citizen or national of the United States and who is in this country on a student visa or
temporary basis and does not have the right to remain indefinitely. Do not include DACA, undocumented, or other eligible noncitizens in
this category.

Dual Enrollment: \f your institution enrolls high school students in college courses for credit either within a dual enrollment program or
outside of a dual enrollment program, you may report the unduplicated count as part of the non-degree-seeking students included in the
“Total Undergraduates (both degree & non-degree-seeking)” section.

Common Data Set 2024-2025

Graduation Rates

The items in this section correspond to data elements collected by the IPEDS Web-based Data Collection System’s Graduation Rate Survey
(GRS). For complete instructions and definitions of data elements, see the IPEDS GRS Forms and Instructions for the 2024-25 Survey.

For Bachelor's or Equivalent Institutions

In the following section for bachelor’s or equivalent programs, please disaggregate the Fall 2017 and Fall 2018 cohorts (formerly CDS B4-
#### B11) into four groups:

* Students who received a Federal Pell Grant*

* Recipients of a subsidized Stafford Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant

* Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a subsidized Stafford Loan

* Total (all students, regardless of Pell Grant or subsidized loan status)

*Students who received both a Federal Pell Grant and a subsidized Stafford Loan should be reported in the "Recipients of a Federal Pell
Grant" column.

For each graduation rate grid below, the numbers in the first three columns for Questions A-G should sum to the cohort total in the fourth
column (formerly CDS B4-B11).

Fall 2018 Cohort

Received Did not receive

Subsidized Stafford Pell Grant or

Received Loan but did not Subsidized
Pell Grant | receive Pell Grant Stafford Loan

(A) Initial 2018 cohort of first-time, full-time bachelor's (or equivalent)
degree seeking undergraduate-students

(B) Of the initial 2018 cohort, how many did not persist and did not
graduate for the following reasons: deceased, permanently disabled,
armed forces, foreign aid service of the federal government, or

First-Time, First-Year Profile

Provide information for ALL enrolled, degree-seeking, full-time and part-time, first-time, first-year students enrolled in Fall 2024,
including students who began studies during summer, international students/nonresident aliens, and students admitted under special
arrangements.

Percent and number of first-time, first-year students enrolled in Fall 2024 who submitted national standardized (SAT/ACT)
« Include information for ALL enrolled, degree-seeking, first-time, first-year students who submitted test scores.

* Do not include partial test scores (e.g., mathematics scores but not critical reading for a category of students) or combine other
standardized test results (such as TOEFL) in this item.

¢ Do not convert SAT scores to ACT scores and vice versa.

¢ If a student submitted multiple sets of scores for a single test, report this information according to how you use the data.
#### For example:

If you consider the highest scores from either submission, use the highest combination of scores (e.g., verbal from one submission,
math from the other).

If you average the scores, use the average to report the scores.

Common Data Set 2024-2025

D22 |Describe other military/veteran transfer credit policies unique to your institution: Brown does not have separate
transfer credit guidelines for military veterans. The maximum number of course credits any student may receive via
transfer is 15.0 course credits. Each 1.0 Brown course credit is equivalent to 4 semester credits or 6 quarter units.
Brown awards transfer credit to incoming transfer students per our pre-Brown transfer credit guidelines (see
https:/Awww.brown.edu/academics/college/advising/transfer-students). Defense Language Institute courses may be
transferred subject to these guidelines. CLEP or DSST test results do not earn transfer credit but may be used by
students (like AP scores and SAT Subject Test results) for placement purposes pending academic department
evaluation and recommendation.

Common Data Set 2024-2025

Student to Faculty Ratio

Report the Fall 2024 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus 1/3 part time) to full-time equivalent instructional faculty (full time
plus 1/3 part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty and students in stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as
medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry, social work, business, or public health in which faculty teach virtually only graduate-level students. Do
not count undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.

Fall 2024 Student to Faculty ratio | 6Ito1 | (based on 7,199]students
and 1,238

faculty).
Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class sections offered in the Fall
2024 term.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number, meeting at a stated time or
times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections
are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning
classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings.
Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all
students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog
cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections
that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections
are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude
noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class
subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class
subsections offered in Fall 2024. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20
students should be counted once in the “100+” column in the class section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class
subsections table.

### J. Degrees Conferred

J1 Degrees conferred between July 1, 2023 and June 30, 2024
For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor’s degrees awarded.
To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice).
Calculate the percentage from your institution’s IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the
numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can
compute the percentages using 1st majors only.

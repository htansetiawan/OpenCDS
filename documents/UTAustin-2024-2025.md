Common Data Set 2024-2025

« Report as your institution reports to IPEDS: persons who are Hispanic should be reported only on the
Hispanic line, not under any race, and persons who are non-Hispanic multi-racial should be reported only
under "Two or more races."

« New guidance from IPEDS for reporting aggregate data:

Racial/ethnic designations are requested only for United States citizens, residents, and other eligible non-citizens.
Eligible non-citizens include all students who completed high school or a GED equivalency within the United States
(including DACA and undocumented students) and who were not on an F-1 non-immigrant student visa at the time of
high school graduation.

More information about other eligible (for financial aid purposes) non-citizens is available at
https://studentaid.gov/understandaid/eligibility/requirements/non-us-citizens.

Nonresident - A person who is not a citizen or national of the United States and who is in this country on a student visa
or temporary basis and does not have the right to remain indefinitely. Do not include DACA, undocumented, or other
eligible noncitizens in this category.

NOTE - Nonresidents are to be reported separately, in the boxes provided, rather than included in any of the seven
racial/ethnic categories or in race/ethnicity unknown.

Dual Enrollment: If your institution enrolls high school students in college courses for credit either within a dual enrollment
program or outside of a dual enrollment program, you may report the unduplicated count as part of the non-degree-
seeking students included in the “Total Undergraduates (both degree & non-degree-seeking)” section.

List the typical tuition, required fees, and food and housing for a full-time undergraduate student for the FULL 2025-2026
academic year. (30 semester hours or 45 quarter hours for institutions that derive annual tuition by multiplying credit hour
cost by number of credits).
* A full academic year refers to the period of time generally extending from September to June; usually

equated to two semesters, two trimesters, three quarters, or the period covered by a four-one-four plan.

* Food and housing is defined as double occupancy and 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan.

* Required fees include only charges that all full-time students must pay that are not included in tuition
(e.g., registration, health, or activity fees.)

* Do not include optional fees (e.g., parking, laboratory use).

## Page 22

Common Data Set 2024-2025

### H1

### H. Financial Aid

Please refer to the following financial aid definitions when completing Section H.
Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.

Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid applications/forms, such as
the FAFSA.

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized, unsubsidized, private, etc.;
excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the
responsibility of the student and should be included.

Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which the institution
determines the recipient.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own standards.

Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a
student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-institutional student aid (grants, jobs, and
loans).

Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a
student must have financial need to qualify.

Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must demonstrate
financial need to qualify.

Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional, state, federal, or
other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement,
merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is used to meet need
should be counted as need-based aid.

Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:

1. Non-need institutional grants 6. Non-need outside grants
2. Non-need tuition waivers 7. Non-need student loans
3. Non-need athletic awards 8. Non-need parent loans
4. Non-need federal grants 9. Non-need work

5. Non-need state grants

Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student need not demonstrate
financial need to qualify.

Private student loans: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or private lender used to pay for up to the
annual cost of education, less any financial aid received.

External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that students bring with them
(e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no role in
determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.

Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your institution in financial aid
awards.

Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates

Enter total dollar amounts awarded to enrolled full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking undergraduates (using the same
cohort reported in CDS Question B1, “total degree-seeking” undergraduates) in the following categories.

« If the data being reported are final figures for the 2023-2024 academic year (see the next item below),
use the 2023-2024 academic year's CDS Question B1 cohort.

« Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid).
* Aid that is non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported in the need-based aid column.

* For a suggested order of precedence in assigning categories of aid to cover need, see the entry for “non-need-based
scholarship or grant aid” on the last page of the definitions section.

Common Data Set 2024-2025

I-2. Student to Faculty Ratio
Report the Fall 2024 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus 1/3 part time) to full-time equivalent instructional faculty
(full time plus 1/3 part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty and students in stand-alone graduate or professional
programs such as medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry, social work, business, or public health in which faculty teach virtually only
graduate level students.

* Do not count undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.

Fall 2024 Student to Faculty ratio (based on 50,310 students
and 2,747 faculty).

I-3. Undergraduate Class Size

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number, meeting at a
stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion session.
Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled
for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis
research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships,
foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted
only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion
subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course.
Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled
for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music
instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of
cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class
subsections offered in Fall 2024. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with
20 students should be counted once in the “100+” column in the class section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of
the class subsections table.

J. Disciplinary areas of DEGREES CONFERRED

Degrees conferred between July 1, 2023 and June 30, 2024

For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor’s degrees awarded. To

determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice).
Calculate the percentage from your institution’s IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the
numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can

compute the percentages using 1st majors only.

B2. Enrollment by Racial/Ethnic Category
Provide numbers of undergraduate students for each of the following categories as of the institution’s official fall reporting date or as of
October 15, 2024.

1. Include international students only in the category "Nonresidents."

2. Complete the “Total Undergraduates” column only if you cannot provide data for the first two columns.

3. Report as your institution reports to IPEDS: persons who are Hispanic should be reported only on the Hispanic line, not under any race,
and persons who are non-Hispanic multi-racial should be reported only under "Two or more races."

4. New guidance from IPEDS for reporting aggregate data: "Racial/ethnic designations are requested only for United States citizens,
residents, and other eligible non-citizens. Eligible non-citizens include all students who completed high school or a GED equivalency within
the United States (including DACA and undocumented students) and who were not on an F-1 non-immigrant student visa at the time of high
school graduation."

5. More information about other eligible (for financial aid purposes) non-citizens is available at
https://studentaid.gov/understandaid/eligibility/requirements/non-us-citizens.

6. Nonresident — A person who is not a citizen or national of the United States and who is in this country on a student visa or temporary
basis and does not have the right to remain indefinitely. Do not include DACA, undocumented, or other eligible noncitizens in this category.
Nonresidents are to be reported separately, in the boxes provided, rather than included in any of the seven racial/ethnic categories or in
race/ethnicity unknown.

The initial cohort may be adjusted for students who departed for the following reasons: Deceased, Armed Forces, Official
church mission, Permanently Disabled, or Foreign Aid Service of the Federal Government.

For the cohort of all full-time bachelor’s (or equivalent) degree-seeking undergraduate students who entered your institution as
first-year students in Fall 2023 (or the preceding summer term):

What percentage was enrolled at your institution as of the date your institution calculates its official enrollment in Fall 2024?

Total students retained = students from the Fall 2023 cohort who are still enrolled as of Fall 2024 + students from
Fall 2023 cohort who completed their bachelor’s program as of Fall 2024

(Students from the Fall 2023 cohort still enrolled as of Fall 2024 + Students from Fall 2024 cohort who completed their
bachelor’s program as of Fall 2024)/(Adjusted Fall 2023 cohort) *100

Note: The number of first-time students seeking a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) who attain a bachelor’s degree (or
equivalent) by their second fall term is expected to be zero or very small. In exceptional cases when a first-time student does
satisfy all degree requirements including full credit completion (e.g., typically 120 credit hours) and is awarded a bachelor’s
degree (or equivalent) by their second fall term, they are to be considered “retained” for EF reporting purposes.

### H. Financial Aid
Please refer to the following financial aid definitions when completing Section H.

Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.

Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid applications/forms, such as the
### Fafsa.

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized, unsubsidized, private, etc.;
excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the
responsibility of the student and should be included.

Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which the institution determines the
recipient.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own standards.

Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must
have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-institutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).

Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must
have financial need to qualify.

Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must demonstrate financial
need to qualify.

Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional, state, federal, or other
sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any
other non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as
need-based aid.

Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student need not demonstrate financial
need to qualify.

Private student loans: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or private lender used to pay for up to the annual
cost of education, less any financial aid received.

External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that students bring with them (e.g.,
Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the
recipient or the dollar amount awarded.

Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your institution in financial aid awards.

Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:

1. Non-need institutional grants 6. Non-need outside grants
2. Non-need tuition waivers 7. Non-need student loans
3. Non-need athletic awards 8. Non-need parent loans
4. Non-need federal grants 9. Non-need work

5. Non-need state grants

H1. Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates
Enter total dollar amounts awarded to enrolled full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking undergraduates (using the same cohort
reported in CDS Question B1, “total degree-seeking” undergraduates) in the following categories.
w~ If the data being reported are final figures for the 2023-24 academic year, use the 2023-24 academic year's CDS Question B1 Cohort.
w Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid).
wo Aid that is non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported in the need-based aid column.

w For a suggested order of precedence in assigning categories of aid to cover need, see the entry for “non-need-based scholarship or
grant aid” on the last page of the definitions section.

The following definition of full-time instructional faculty is used by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) in its annual
Faculty Compensation Survey (the part time definitions are not used by AAUP). Instructional Faculty is defined as those members of the
instructional-research staff whose major regular assignment is instruction, including those with released time for research.

Full-Time Part-Time

A. Instructional faculty in preclinical and clinical medicine, faculty who are not paid Include only if they teach

Exclude one or more non-clinical

faculty, post-doctoral fellows, or pre-doctoral fellows

B. Administrative officers with titles such as dean of students, librarian, registrar,
coach, and the like, even though they may devote part of their time to classroom

credit courses
Include only if they teach
one or more non-clinical

instruction and may have faculty status credit courses
C. Other administrators/staff who teach one or more non-clinical credit courses
even though they do not have faculty status

D. Undergraduate or graduate students who assist in the instruction of courses,
but have titles such as teaching assistant, teaching fellow, and the like

13. Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below, please report information about the size of classes and class sections offered in the Fall 2024 term.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number, meeting at a stated time or times
in aclassroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as
any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit
classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in
independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one
classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are
supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined
as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and
individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be
counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class subsections
offered in fall. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted

#### J. DISCIPLINARY AREAS OF DEGREES CONFERRED

Degrees conferred between July 1, 2023 and June 30, 2024.
For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor’s degrees awarded. To
determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice).

Calculate the percentage from your institution’s IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the
numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can
compute the percentages using 1st majors only.

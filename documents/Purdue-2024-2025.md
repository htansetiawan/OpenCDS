Racial/ethnic designations are requested only for United States citizens, residents, and other eligible non-citizens.
Eligible non-citizens include all students who completed high school or a GED equivalency within the United States
(including DACA and undocumented students) and who were not on an F-1 non-immigrant student visa at the time of
high school graduation.

More information about other eligible (for financial aid purposes) non-citizens is available at
https://studentaid.gov/understandaid/eligibility/requirements/non-us-citizens.

Nonresident - A person who is not a citizen or national of the United States and who is in this country on a student visa
or temporary basis and does not have the right to remain indefinitely. Do not include DACA, undocumented, or other
eligible noncitizens in this category.

Common Data Set 2024-2025

For Two-Year Institutions

Please provide data for the 2021 cohort if available. If 2021 cohort data are not available, provide data for the 2020 cohort.

2021 Cohort 2020 Cohort

B12 |Initial cohort, total of first-time, full-time degree/certificate-seeking students:

B13 |Of the initial cohort, how many did not persist and did not graduate for the following reasons:

* Death

+ Permanently Disability

* Service in the armed forces,

+ Foreign aid service of the federal government
* Official church missions

+ Report total allowable exclusions

B14 |Final cohort, after adjusting for allowable exclusions: 0 0

B15 |Completers of programs of less than two years duration (total):

B16 |Completers of programs of less than two years within 150 percent of normal time:

B17 |Completers of programs of at least two but less than four years (total):

B18 |Completers of programs of at least two but less than four-years within 150 percent of normal time:

B19 | Total transfers-out (within three years) to other institutions:

#### B20 | Total transfers to two-year institutions:

#### B21 | Total transfers to four-year institutions:

B22. Retention Rates

Report for the cohort of all full-time, first-time bachelor’s (or equivalent) degree-seeking undergraduate students who entered in Fall 2023 (or the preceding
summer term).

* The initial cohort may be adjusted for students who departed for the following reasons:

* Death

* Permanent Disability

* Service in the armed forces

* Foreign aid service of the federal government

* Official church missions

* No other adjustments to the initial cohort should be made.

B22 For the cohort of all full-time bachelor’s (or equivalent) degree-seeking undergraduate students who entered your
institution as first-year students in Fall 2023 (or the preceding summer term), what percentage was enrolled at your
institution as of the date your institution calculates its official enrollment in Fall 2024.

Total students retained = students from the Fall 2023 cohort who are still enrolled as of Fall 2024 + students
from Fall 2023 cohort who completed their bachelor’s program as of Fall 2024
(Students from the Fall 2023 cohort still enrolled as of Fall 2024 + Students from Fall 2023 cohort who
completed their bachelor’s program as of Fall 2024)/(Adjusted Fall 2023 cohort) *100
Note: The number of first-time students seeking a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) who attain a bachelor’s
degree (or equivalent) by their second fall term is expected to be zero or very small. In exceptional cases when a
first-time student does satisfy all degree requirements including full credit completion (e.g., typically 120 credit
hours) and is awarded a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) by their second fall term, they are to be considered
“retained” for EF reporting purposes.

Common Data Set 2024-2025

### H1

### H. Financial Aid

Please refer to the following financial aid definitions when completing Section H.
Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.

Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid applications/forms, such as
the FAFSA.

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized, unsubsidized, private,
etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to
be the responsibility of the student and should be included.

Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which the institution
determines the recipient.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own standards.

Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a
student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-institutional student aid (grants, jobs, and
loans).

Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a
student must have financial need to qualify.

Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must demonstrate
financial need to qualify.

Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional, state, federal, or
other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement,
merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is used to meet need
should be counted as need-based aid.

Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:

1. Non-need institutional grants 6. Non-need outside grants
2. Non-need tuition waivers 7. Non-need student loans
3. Non-need athletic awards 8. Non-need parent loans
4. Non-need federal grants 9. Non-need work

5. Non-need state grants

Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student need not
demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Private student loans: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or private lender used to pay for up to the
annual cost of education, less any financial aid received.

External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that students bring with them
(e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no role in
determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.

Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your institution in financial aid
awards.

Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates

Enter total dollar amounts awarded to enrolled full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking undergraduates (using the same
cohort reported in CDS Question B1, “total degree-seeking” undergraduates) in the following categories.

« — If the data being reported are final figures for the 2023-2024 academic year (see the next item below),
use the 2023-2024 academic year's CDS Question B1 cohort.
* — Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid).
¢ Aid that is non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported in the need-based aid
column.
* For a suggested order of precedence in assigning categories of aid to cover need, see the entry for “non-need-based
scholarship or grant aid” on the last page of the definitions section.

1-3. Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and
class sections offered in the Fall 2024 term.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and
number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as
a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at
least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes
and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction,
or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships,
foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class
section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-

listinas.
Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory,

recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet
separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any
subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above,
exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music
instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not
be duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of
class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2024. For example, a lecture class with 800 students
who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+”
column in the class section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections table.

J. Disciplinary areas of DEGREES CONFERRED

Degrees conferred between July 1, 2023 and June 30, 2024

For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor’s degrees awarded. To

determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice).
Calculate the percentage from your institution’s IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the
numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can

compute the percentages using 1st majors only.

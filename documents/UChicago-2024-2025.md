In the following section for bachelor’s or equivalent programs, please disaggregate the Fall 2017 and Fall 2018 cohorts (formerly CDS B4-B11) into
four groups:
• Students who received a Federal Pell Grant*
• Recipients of a subsidized Stafford Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant
• Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a subsidized Stafford Loan
• Total (all students, regardless of Pell Grant or subsidized loan status)
*Students who received both a Federal Pell Grant and a subsidized Stafford Loan should be reported in the "Recipients of a Federal Pell Grant" column.
For each graduation rate grid below, the numbers in the first three columns for Questions A-G should sum to the cohort total in the fourth column (formerly
CDS B4-B11). |

B22. Retention Rates

Report for the cohort of all full-time, first-time bachelor’s (or equivalent) degree-seeking undergraduate students who entered in Fall 2023 (or the preceding

summer term).

* The initial cohort may be adjusted for students who departed for the following reasons:
* Death

* Permanent Disability

* Service in the armed forces

* Foreign aid service of the federal government

* Official church missions

* No other adjustments to the initial cohort should be made.

For the cohort of all full-time bachelor’s (or equivalent) degree-seeking undergraduate students who
entered your institution as first-year students in Fall 2023 (or the preceding summer term), what
percentage was enrolled at your institution as of the date your institution calculates its official enrollment in

Fall 2024.

Total students retained = students from the Fall 2023 cohort who are still enrolled as of Fall 2024 +
students from Fall 2023 cohort who completed their bachelor’s program as of Fall 2024

(Students from the Fall 2023 cohort still enrolled as of Fall 2024 + Students from Fall 2023 cohort
who completed their bachelor’s program as of Fall 2024)/(Adjusted Fall 2023 cohort) *100

Note: The number of first-time students seeking a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) who attain a
bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) by their second fall term is expected to be zero or very small. In
exceptional cases when a first-time student does satisfy all degree requirements including full
credit completion (e.g., typically 120 credit hours) and is awarded a bachelor’s degree (or
equivalent) by their second fall term, they are to be considered “retained” for EF reporting

purposes.

admission (i.e., who completed actionable applications) and who have been notified of one of the
following actions: admission, non-admission, placement on waiting list, or application withdrawn (by

applicant or institution).

* Since the total may include students who did not provide gender data, the detail need not sum to the total.

* — If your institution collects and reports non-binary gender data, please use the "Another Gender" category.

+ Note that recent high school graduates and other students without prior postsecondary experience will still
be considered "first-time students" for fall enrollment reporting purposes even if they enrolled in the summer

prior to fall enrollment.

### H1

### H. Financial Aid

Please refer to the following financial aid definitions when completing Section H.
Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.

Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required
financial aid applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state,
subsidized, unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at
an institution. Student loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the

Atedant and aba. ba ienahedad

Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded
grants for which the institution determines the recipient.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your
institution's own standards.

Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal,
or other sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both
institutional and non-institutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).

Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal,
or other sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify.

Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for
which a student must demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid
from institutional, state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and
endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other
non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is used
to meet need should be counted as need-based aid.

Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:

1. Non-need institutional grants 6. Non-need outside grants
2. Non-need tuition waivers 7. Non-need student loans
3. Non-need athletic awards 8. Non-need parent loans
4. Non-need federal grants 9. Non-need work

5. Non-need state grants

Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for
which a student need not demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Private student loans: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or
private lender used to pay for up to the annual cost of education, less any financial aid received.

External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private)
sources that students bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution
may process paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or
Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment
packaged by your institution in financial aid awards.

Common Data Set 2024-2025

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and
number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a
laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at
least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes
and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or
one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign
language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section
should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory,
recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet
separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any
subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above,
exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music
instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be
duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class
sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2024. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who
met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+” column in
the class section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections table.

J. Disciplinary areas of DEGREES CONFERRED

Degrees conferred between July 1, 2023 and June 30, 2024

For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor’s degrees awarded. To
determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice).
Calculate the percentage from your institution’s IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the
numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can

compute the percentages using 1st majors only.

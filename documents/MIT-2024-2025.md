B4-B21: Graduation Rates
The items in this section correspond to data elements collected by the IPEDS Web-based Data Collection
System's Graduation Rate Survey (GRS).

For complete instructions and definitions of data elements, see the IPEDS GRS Forms and Instructions for the
2024-2025 Survey.

In the following section for bachelor’s or equivalent programs, please disaggregate the Fall 2017 and Fall 2018
#### cohorts (formerly CDS B4-B11) into four groups:

e Students who received a Federal Pell Grant*

e Recipients of a subsidized Stafford Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant

e Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a subsidized Stafford Loan
¢ Total (all students, regardless of Pell Grant or subsidized loan status)

*Students who received both a Federal Pell Grant and a subsidized Stafford Loan should be reported in the
“Recipients of a Federal Pell Grant” column.

For each graduation rate grid below, the numbers in the first three columns for Questions A-G should sum to the
cohort total in the fourth column (formerly CDS B4-B1)).

For Bachelor’s or Equivalent Programs

Please provide data for the Fall 2018 cohort if available. If Fall 2018 cohort data are not available, provide data for
the Fall 2017 cohort.

For the cohort of all full-time bachelor’s (or equivalent) degree-seeking undergraduate students who entered your
institution as first-year students in Fall 2023 (or the preceding summer term), what percentage was enrolled at
your institution as of the date your institution calculates its official enrollment in Fall 2024.

Total students retained = students from the Fall 2023 cohort who are still enrolled as of Fall 2024 + students from
Fall 2023 cohort who completed their bachelor’s program as of Fall 2024

(Students from the Fall 2023 cohort still enrolled as of Fall 2024 + Students from Fall 2023 cohort who completed
their bachelor’s program as of Fall 2024)/(Adjusted Fall 2023 cohort) *100

Note: The number of first-time students seeking a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) who attain a bachelor’s degree
(or equivalent) by their second fall term is expected to be zero or very small. In exceptional cases when a first-time
student does satisfy all degree requirements including full credit completion (e.g., typically 120 credit hours) andis
awarded a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) by their second fall term, they are to be considered “retained” for EF
reporting purposes.

### C. First-Time, First-Year Admission

C1-C2: Applications

C1. First-time, first-year students: Provide the number of degree-seeking, first-time, first-year students who
applied, were admitted, and enrolled (full- or part-time) in Fall 2024.

e Include early decision, early action, and students who began studies during summer in this cohort.

e Applicants should include only those students who fulfilled the requirements for consideration for admission (i.e.,
who completed actionable applications) and who have been notified of one of the following actions: admission,
non-admission, placement on waiting list, or application withdrawn (by applicant or institution).

e Admitted applicants should include wait-listed students who were subsequently offered admission.

e Since the total may include students who did not provide gender data, the detail need not sum to the total.

e |f your institution collects and reports non-binary gender data, please use the “Another Gender” category.

e Note that recent high school graduates and other students without prior postsecondary experience will still be
considered “first-time students’ for fall enrollment reporting purposes even if they enrolled in the summer prior
to fall enrollment.

e Provide numbers of students for each of the following categories as of the institution's official fall reporting date
or as of October 15, 2024.

instructional faculty (full time plus 1/3 part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty and students in
stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry, social work, business,

I-3. Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class
sections offered in the Fall 2024 term.

Class Sections; Aclass section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number,
meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not asubsection such as a laboratory or
discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-
seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and
individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude
students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions,
practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should
not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and
discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture
portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-

seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction
such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should
be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class
sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2024. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at
another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+” column in the class
section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections table.

J. Disciplinary areas of DEGREES CONFERRED

Degrees conferred between July 1, 2023 and June 30, 2024

For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and
bachelor’s degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one
degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution’s IPEDS
Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand
Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the
percentages using ist majors only.

Note: Diploma/Certificates and Associate degrees are not awarded by MIT. The columns have been omitted.

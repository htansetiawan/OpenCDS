Common Data Set 2024-2025

Welcome to the 2024-2025 Common Data Set collection!

The Common Data Set (CDS) initiative is a collaborative effort among data providers in
the higher education community and publishers as represented by the College Board,
Peterson’s, and U.S. News & World Report. The combined goal of this collaboration is
to improve the quality and accuracy of information provided to all involved in a student's
transition into higher education, as well as to reduce the reporting burden on data
providers.

The CDS is a set of standards and definitions of data items rather than a survey
instrument or set of data represented in a database. Each of the higher education surveys
conducted by the participating publishers incorporates items from the CDS as well as
unique items proprietary to each publisher. Consequently, the publishers’ surveys differ in
that they utilize varying numbers of items from the CDS.

Those who report data for their colleges are urged to abide by the definitions and the
cohorts specified when answering CDS items. They are also urged to use the answers to
CDS items when responding to the numerous survey requests they receive, by
distributing photocopies of their answers, posting them on their websites, or by other
effective means.

Further information about the CDS initiative can be found at https://commondataset.org/.

Please contact Peterson's Research at research@petersons.com should you have any
questions about this PDF template.

B2. Enrollment by Racial/Ethnic Category

Provide numbers of undergraduate students for each of the following categories as of the institution's
official fall reporting date or as of October _ 15, 2024.

¥ Include international students only in the category "Nonresidents."
¥ Complete the “Total Undergraduates” column only if you cannot provide data for the first two columns.

v¥ Report as your institution reports to IPEDS: persons who are Hispanic should be reported only on the

under "Two or more races."

v¥ New guidance from IPEDS for reporting aggregate data:
Racial/ethnic destinations are requested only for United States citizens, residents, and other eligible non-citizens.

Eligible non-citizens include all students who completed high school or a GED equivalency within the United
States (including DACA and undocumented students) and who were not an F-1 non-immigrant student visa at
the time of high school graduation.

More information about other eligible (for financial aid purposes) non-citizens is available at
https://studentaid.gov/understandaid/eligibility/requirements/non-us-citizens.

Nonresident — A person who is not a citizen or national of the United States and who is in this country on a
student visa or temporary basis and does not have the right to remain indefinitely. Do not include DACA,
undocumented, or other eligible noncitizens in this category.

NOTE — Nonresidents are to be reported separately, in the boxes provided, rather than included in any of the
seven racial/ethnic categories or in race/ethnicity unknown.

NOTE — Nonresidents are to be reported separately, in the boxes provided, rather than included in any of the seven
racial/ethnic categories or in race/ethnicity unknown. Dual Enrollment: If your institution enrolls high school students

B4-B21: Graduation Rates

The items in this section correspond to data elements collected by the IPEDS Web-based Data Collection
System’s Graduation Rate Survey (GRS).

¥ For complete instructions and definitions of data elements, see the IPEDS GRS Forms and Instructions
for the 2024-2025 Survey. https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data/survey-components/9/graduation-rates

In the following section for bachelor’s or equivalent programs, please disaggregate the Fall 2017 and Fall
#### 2018 cohorts (formerly CDS B4-B11) into four groups:

Students who received a Federal Pell Grant*

Recipients of a subsidized Stafford Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant

Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a subsidized Stafford Loan
Total (all students, regardless of Pell Grant or subsidized loan status)

* Students who received both a Federal Pell Grant and a subsidized Stafford Loan should be reported

in the "Recipients of a Federal Pell Grant" column.

For each graduation rate grid below, the numbers in the first three columns for Questions A-G should sum to the
cohort total in the fourth column (formerly CDS B4-B11).

Please provide data for the Fall 2018 cohort if available. If Fall 2018 cohort data are not available,

For Bachelor’s or Equivalent Programs

provide data for the Fall 2017 cohort.

Common Data Set 2024-2025

B22. Retention Rates

Report for the cohort of all full-time, first-time bachelor’s (or equivalent) degree-seeking undergraduate
students who entered in Fall 2023 (or the preceding summer term).

¥ The initial cohort may be adjusted for students who departed for the following reasons:

Death

Permanent Disability

Service in the armed forces

Foreign aid service of the federal government

Official church missions

No other adjustments to the initial cohort should be made.

#### + + 4 + + F

For the cohort of all full-time bachelor’s (or equivalent) degree-seeking undergraduate students who
entered your institution as first-year students in Fall 2023 (or the preceding summer term), what
percentage was enrolled at your institution as of the date your institution calculates its official
enrollment in Fall 2024.

Total students retained = Students from the Fall 2023 cohort who are still enrolled as of Fall 2024 +
students from Fall 2023 cohort who completed their bachelor's program as of Fall 2024

(Students from the Fall 2023 cohort still enrolled as of Fall 2024 + Students from Fall 2023 cohort who
completed their bachelor’s program as of Fall 2024)/(Adjusted Fall 2023 cohort) *100

Note: The number of first-time students seeking a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) who attain a
bachelor's degree (or equivalent) by their second fall term is expected to be zero or very small. In
exceptional cases when a first-time student does satisfy all degree requirements including full credit
completion (e.g., typically 120 credit hours) and is awarded a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) by their
second fall term, they are to be considered “retained” for EF reporting purposes.

Common Data Set 2024-2025

### H. Financial Aid
Please refer to the following financial aid definitions when completing Section H.
Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.

Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid
applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized,
unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student loans
co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.

Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which the
institution determines the recipient.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own
standards.

Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources
for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-institutional student
aid (grants, jobs, and loans).

Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources
for which a student must have financial need to qualify.

Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student
must demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional,
state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the
basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H1 and H2,
non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need-based aid.

Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:

Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student need
not demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Private student loans: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or private lender used to
pay for up to the annual cost of education, less any financial aid received.

External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that students
bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive the
dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.

Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your institution
in financial aid awards.

(AAUP) in its annual Faculty Compensation Survey (the part time definitions are not used by AAUP). Instructional
Faculty is defined as those members of the instructional-research staff whose major regular assignment is
instruction, including those with released time for research. Use the chart below to determine inclusions and
#### exclusions:

Also includes full-time faculty teaching less than two semesters, three quarters, two trimesters, or two four-month
sessions. Employees who are not considered full-time instruction faculty but who teach one or more non-clinical
credit courses may be counted as part-time faculty.

Minority faculty: includes faculty who designate themselves as Black, non-Hispanic; American Indian or Alaska
Native; Asian, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, or Hispanic.

Doctorate: includes such degrees as Doctor of Philosophy, Doctor of Education, Doctor of Juridical Science, and

administration. Also includes terminal degrees formerly designated as “first professional,” including dentistry (DDS
or DMD), medicine (MD), optometry (OD), osteopathic medicine (DO), pharmacy (DPharm or BPharm), podiatric
medicine (DPM), veterinary medicine (DVM), chiropractic (DC or DCM), or law (JD).

I-3. Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class
sections offered in the Fall 2024 term.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number,
meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or
discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking
undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual
instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in
independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all
students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated
because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and
discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture
portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-
seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction
such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be
counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class
sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2024. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met

at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+” column in the
class section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections table.

J. Disciplinary areas of DEGREES CONFERRED
Degrees conferred between July 1, 2023 and June 30, 2024

For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor’s
degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a
double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution’s IPEDS Completions by
using the sum of 1S and 24 majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by ‘st
Majors and the Grand Total by 24 major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using
1st majors only.

Accelerated program: Completion of a college program of study in fewer than the usual number of years, most often by
attending summer sessions and carrying extra courses during the regular academic term.

Admitted student: Applicant who is offered admission to a degree-granting program at your institution.

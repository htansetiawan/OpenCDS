B4-B21: Graduation Rates

The items in this section correspond to data elements collected by the IPEDS Web-based Data Collection System’s Graduation Rate
Survey (GRS).

* For complete instructions and definitions of data elements, see the IPEDS GRS Forms and Instructions
for the 2024-2025 Survey. https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data/survey-components/9/graduation-rates

In the following section for bachelor’s or equivalent programs, please disaggregate the Fall 2017 and Fall 2018 cohorts (formerly CDS B4-B11)
#### into four groups:

* Students who received a Federal Pell Grant*

+ Recipients of a subsidized Stafford Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant

* Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a subsidized Stafford Loan

+ Total (all students, regardless of Pell Grant or subsidized loan status)

*Students who received both a Federal Pell Grant and a subsidized Stafford Loan should be reported in the "Recipients of a Federal Pell Grant" column.

For each graduation rate grid below, the numbers in the first three columns for Questions A-G should sum to the cohort total in the fourth column (formerly
### Cds B4-B11).

List the typical tuition, required fees, and food and housing for a full-time undergraduate student for the

FULL 2025-2026 academic year. (30 semester hours or 45 quarter hours for institutions that derive annual

tuition by multiplying credit hour cost by number of credits).

* A full academic year refers to the period of time generally extending from September to June; usually
equated to two semesters, two trimesters, three quarters, or the period covered by a four-one-four plan.

* Food and housing is defined as double occupancy and 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan.

* Required fees include only charges that all full-time students must pay that are not included in tuition
(e.g., registration, health, or activity fees.)

* Do not include optional fees (e.g., parking, laboratory use).

### H1

### H. Financial Aid

Please refer to the following financial aid definitions when completing Section H.
Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.

Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid
applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized,
unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution.
Student loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be

Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for
which the institution determines the recipient.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's
own standards.

Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other
sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-
institutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).

Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other
sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify.

Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a
student must demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from
institutional, state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income)
awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason.
When reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted
as need-based aid.

Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:

1. Non-need institutional grants 6. Non-need outside grants
2. Non-need tuition waivers 7. Non-need student loans
3. Non-need athletic awards 8. Non-need parent loans
4. Non-need federal grants 9. Non-need work

5. Non-need state grants

Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a
student need not demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Private student loans: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or private
lender used to pay for up to the annual cost of education, less any financial aid received.

External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources
that students bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process
paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount

Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your
institution in financial aid awards.

Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates

Enter total dollar amounts awarded to enrolled full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking

undergraduates (using the same cohort reported in CDS Question B1, “total degree-seeking”

undergraduates) in the following categories.

* — If the data being reported are final figures for the 2023-2024 academic year (see the next item

below),

* Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid).

¢ Aid that is non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported in the need-based aid
column.

* For a suggested order of precedence in assigning categories of aid to cover need, see the entry for

“non-need-based scholarship or grant aid” on the last page of the definitions section.

Common Data Set 2024-2025

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and
class sections offered in the Fall 2024 term.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and
number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as
a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at
least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes
and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction,
or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships,
foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class
section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-
listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory,
recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet
separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any
subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above,
exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music
instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not
be duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of
class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2024. For example, a lecture class with 800 students
who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+”
column in the class section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections table.

Common Data Set 2024-2025

J. Disciplinary areas of DEGREES CONFERRED

J1 Degrees conferred between July 1, 2023 and June 30, 2024
For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor’s degrees awarded. To
determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice).
Calculate the percentage from your institution's IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the
numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can
compute the percentages using 1st majors only.
